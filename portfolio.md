<b>Who am I?</b>

<br>

<p align="justify">I’m a data analyst focused on turning data into actionable insights using tools like BigQuery, Google Analytics, Tableau or Looker. I have a passion for web analytics and user tracking on the internet with experience in both the e-commerce and banking sectors as a BI Data Specialist. As a Ph.D. candidate at Charles University in Prague, I’m applying advanced research methods with practical applications in governance, focusing on regulations and policies. I spent a year of my research in the United States as a visiting scholar and presented at several scientific conferences.</p>

<p align="justify">This website serves to share my research findings and as a portfolio of my work. Here I also test the deployment of measurement tags designed for web analysis.</p>
